Of course! Here's a documentation structure you can use for your Readme.md:

Application Description
This application serves as a utility tool designed to validate strings based on specific criteria. It ensures that a given input meets the requirements of containing uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, predefined special characters, and adheres to a specified maximum length. Moreover, the utility ensures that the input does not contain any whitespace characters.

Regex Implementation Description
The core of the application lies in the implementation of a regular expression (regex). This regex is dynamically generated based on a provided maximum length and checks for the presence of specific character types (uppercase, lowercase, digit, special character) while simultaneously ensuring the absence of whitespace characters. By utilizing the power of regex, the application achieves efficient and reliable validation, making it suitable for various use cases, from form validation to security checks.
